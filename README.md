Object-oriented website engineering: Applying the discipline of Meyer's OOSC to SPA Web 3.x technologies

This repository introduces what will likely be a multi-year project to bring professional engineering practice to the design and development of single page websites.  The repository's motivation is the writing of a book to be published using Leanpub. The intention is to connect the principles of Bertrand Meyer's work "Object-Oriented Software Construction" with the recently introduced Typescript pre-processor for Javascript.  Typescript takes advantage of facilities in Ecmascript 5 to introduce the formalities of 'class'.  As a result, this opens the door to connect the idea of abstract data classes with the design of Web 3.0 websites.  Additionally, it is possible to add the formalities of 'design by contract' to the process.

(More, much more, to come...)
